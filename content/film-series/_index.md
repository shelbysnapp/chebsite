In this series, I plan to work my way through the List of 100 Italian Films to be Saved. 

What is this list?
--> According to Wikipedia:
"The list of A hundred Italian films to be saved (Italian: Cento film italiani da salvare) was created with the aim to report "100 films that have changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978". Film preservation, or film restoration, describes a series of ongoing efforts among film historians, archivists, museums, cinematheques, and nonprofit organization to rescue decaying film stock and preserve the images they contain. In the widest sense, preservation assures that a movie will continue to exist in as close to its original form as possible."

Why am I doing this?
--> I've had an interest in classic Italian cinema since visiting a Fellini exhibit at the Kunsthaus Zürich in 2022. One night, I had the house to myself and stumbled across the film Il Posto on Netflix. I watched it and loved it. When reading about it on Wikipedia, I stumbled across this list. There are some titles and names that are familiar to me (Fellini, Rossini, etc.), but the vast majority are films I've never heard of. Thus, begins our adventure.
